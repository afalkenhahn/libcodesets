  * misc: reworked the whole API of the CodesetsFindBestA() function which
    was more or less unused until today. The function now only accepts a
    variable tagitem list. All former fixed arguments have to be set via
    TagItems now. This should make the function more flexible for the
    future. In addition, I added the cyrillic codeset autodetection code
    kindly provided by Alexey Ivanov. codesets.library can now be used
    together with the new CSA_CodesetsFamily attribute to specify the
    family to which against the supplied text should be matched. This will
    also allow to add more different codeset families in future to the
    autodetection. Revised the autodocs and includes of CodesetsFindBest()
    accordingly.

  * Makefile.os4, libinit.c: reworked the OS4 library interface to
    cleanly compile with newlib instead of clib2. Future OS4 version will
    be built for newlib only as that is the standard runtime library for
    AmigaOS4.

2006-04-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * libinit.c: slightly reworked the library init/expunge code to act a
    bit more robust and don't use any semaphore during the library expunge
    phase which in fact should cure the crashing on MorphOS during
    expunging of the library.

#### 6.1 RELEASE #########################################################

2006-03-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: replaced the underscore char '_' use for an unknown char
    during an UTF-8 conversion by a questionmark '?' as this might be
    a more proper replacement and it doesn't trigger YAM's text
    highlighting routines.
  * codesets.c: slightly reworked the ReadTable() function. Reworked
    the CodesetsUTF8ToStrA() function to correctly take respect of the
    CSA_SourceLen attribute as documented. Previously it always
    converted until strlen(src). Now in case the SourceLen is specified
    it will stop converting the UTF8 string.
  * libinit.c, base.h: moved the internal charset table initialization
    routine from the LibInit() function to the first call of the
    LibOpen(). This in fact should fix the various strange crash bugs
    reported since the release of 6.0.
  * init.c: changed the library base definitions to use "extern" and
    also define "__UtilityBase" to please constraints of clib2.

  * misc: switched from CVS to the new SVN (subversion) services of
    sf.net. Should should definitly increase our project's flexibility.

2006-02-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * utils.c: removed the unnecessary snprintf()/sprintf() stuff as it
    is not required anymore.
  * codesets.c: fixed some minor compiler warnings and added some more
    debug output.
  * include/SDI_lib.h: updated to latest SDI_lib.h, which fixes some
    compiler issues with GCC3+ under OS3.

#### 6.0 RELEASE #########################################################

2006-02-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final 6.0 release preparations.
  * codesets.doc: updated the autodocs according to our latest changes
    sind the open-source release of the library. Added some common
    examples and also restructed it.
  * codesets.c: changed all "struct MinList *" related functions to use
    the newly defined "struct codesetList *" instead. This new type
    instead of the public MinList type keeps those functions more
    flexible in future.
  * codesets.c: changed CodesetsListDelete() to be a tagitem receiving
    function. This should make it much more usable in future.
  * codesets.c: modified all CodesetsListX() functions to return a
    boolean value to signal if an operating succeeded or not.
  * libraries/codesets.h: changed all tag items to carry the shortcut
    CSA instead of the long CODESETSA_XXXX string. This should make the
    use of codesets.library more intuitive.

2006-02-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: changed the scandir function to use ExAll() instead
    of using the FileInfoBlock structures. This should be slightly
    faster and more consistent.
  * codesets.c: replaced the previously added internal private
    codeset list management functions with a more transparent
    approach using separate functions (CodesetsListCreateA(),
    CodesetsListDelete(), etc.). Now a user may generate an
    unlimited number of own private codesets lists allowing him
    to load additional codesets on runtime from either a directory,
    file or already existing codesets.

2006-02-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c: added a new internal "findPrivateCodesetList()"
    function and made CodesetsFindA()/CodesetsFindBestA() aware of
    the newly added CODESETSA_RefTask attribute which will allow a
    user to directly specify the referencing task for searching for
    a private codesets list. This in fact may only be used in
    multithreaded applications where functions like CodesetsFindA()
    are used from a different task/thread than the OpenLibrary()
    of codesets.library was done.

2006-02-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: implemented a private codeset management facility. Now
    codeset.library will automatically scan an eventually existing
    PROGDIR:Charsets and if present will load those codesets in a
    per-task private list of codesets which will be added to the
    global list of supported codesets as well.
  * misc: implemented new CodesetsConvertStrA() library function which
    will allow to specify a source and destination codeset as well as
    a source string. The source string is then automatically converted
    to the supplied destination string. This in turn should give a
    plenty transparent method to convert strings from one codeset
    to another.
  * added the UTF-8 codeset to the internal list of supported codesets.
    However, as the UTF-8 codeset is a very central codeset it is
    treated special in such case that if UTF8Create() is used with a
    string that is already encoded in UTF8, false will be returned.

  * init.c: changed the system default charset identification routines
    to use the GetDiskFontCtrl() function on AmigaOS4 to find out
    the currently active system charset. In addition, if this
    identification fails it will try to find out the charset by falling
    back to checking ENV:CHARSET, then using ENV:LANGUAGE to parse ther
    internal language<>codeset list and if this also fails it will
    directly use locale.library to find out the language to check
    our own internal fallback tables for default charset<>language
    mapping.
  * codesets.c: if running on AmigaOS4, codesets.library will now
    automatically query diskfont.library for the existing codesets
    and also load all existing mapping tables accordingly. It will
    also check if all internally known codesets are already present
    and if one of it was not loaded through diskfont.library, the
    internal mapping tables will be used as well.
  * debug.c,h: added a whole debugging output system adapted and
    relicensed from the YAM project. Now an environment variable
    can be usd (ENV:codesets.library.debug) to place debugging
    tags and allow to differniate which output should be displayed
    during runtime and which one not. This should hopefully make
    the debugging of the library much more easier.

2005-12-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * codesets.c, codesets_table.h: updated internal codesets
    implementations in accordance to the latest implementation in
    SimpleMail. Now codesets.library also supports the Amiga-1251
    and ISO-8859-16.
  * misc: did some general housekeeping code cleanups.

2005-12-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * developer/examples: ported the demo1.c application to all our
    supported platforms
  * include/SDI_*.h: update SDI headers to latest versions.

2005-12-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * bumped version to v6 as the GCC/OS4 porting may introduce some
    oddities which we might eliminate during the v6 release cycle.
    Please note that this first OS3/GCC and OS4 porting effort may
    still contain some oddities here and there as large portions are
    still untested. However, we may have some time to fix step by step
    until we can prepare a v6.0 release.
  * got rid of all common compiler warnings which should make bug
    hunting much more easier.
  * restructed sources to use othe latest SDI-headers for easily
    maintaining the sources for all three platforms without
    introducing heaps to #ifdef's.
  * dropped all "register" attribute usages as modern compilers like
    GCC normally know where to put variables on registers and where not
    so these attributes are anyway not necessary.
  * dropped smakefile and all 68k ASM parts as we are moving towards
    building with GCC for all targets.
  * restructed the build environment of codesets.library to use
    GCC for all three major platforms (OS3/OS4/MOS). Also dropped
    the SAS/C build process. Sorry, but SAS/C is really way too old
    and too buggy to still be considered a sensible compiler and
    maintaining codesets.library for the very same compiler should
    eliminate some problems in future, too.
  * partly applied OS4 porting patch supplied by Alexandre Balaban.

  * initial checkin of LGPLed sources
