    * bumped version to v6 as the GCC/OS4 porting may introduce some
      oddities which we might eliminate during the v6 release cycle.
      Please note that this first OS3/GCC and OS4 porting effort may
      still contain some oddities here and there as large portions are
      still untested. However, we may have some time to fix step by step
      until we can prepare a v6.0 release.
    * got rid of all common compiler warnings which should make bug
      hunting much more easier.
    * restructed sources to use othe latest SDI-headers for easily
      maintaining the sources for all three platforms without
      introducing heaps to #ifdef's.
    * dropped all "register" attribute usages as modern compilers like
      GCC normally know where to put variables on registers and where not
      so these attributes are anyway not necessary.
    * dropped smakefile and all 68k ASM parts as we are moving towards
      building with GCC for all targets.
    * restructed the build environment of codesets.library to use
      GCC for all three major platforms (OS3/OS4/MOS). Also dropped
      the SAS/C build process. Sorry, but SAS/C is really way too old
      and too buggy to still be considered a sensible compiler and
      maintaining codesets.library for the very same compiler should
      eliminate some problems in future, too.
    * partly applied OS4 porting patch supplied by Alexandre Balaban.
